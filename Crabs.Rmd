Uploading Files into R and Adding appropriate libraries

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/chanceyan/Documents/R/ThesisCrab")
crabdata <- read.csv("Feeding.csv", h=T)
death <- read.csv("Death.csv", h=T)
```

We need to clean up the data first to use it. What I did was upload the R data and created a new value for each crab feeding point. The new value was propotion eaten calculated by taking the amount eaten and diving it by the body weight of the crab. After, I pushed all those who did not eat to 0, those who ate everything and died I removed. I also removed those who molted during the experiment. I also will remove the mackerel and mussel feeding since these were only done once and didn't work well.

```{R include = FALSE}
crabdata$FoodIn <- as.numeric(as.character(crabdata$FoodIn))
crabdata$FoodOut <- as.numeric(as.character(crabdata$FoodOut))

for(i in 1:nrow(crabdata)){
  if(!is.numeric(crabdata[i,4])){
    crabdata <- crabdata[-i,]
  }
  if(!is.numeric(crabdata[i,6])){
    crabdata <- crabdata[-i,]
  }
}

#Creating number IDs for each crab based of their IDs so it's easier to loop through with future code. Also I'm adding a total eaten by proportion column, so we have a fair metric to compare by.

for(i in 1:36){
  master$num[[i]] <- substr(master$ID[[i]], 3,5)
}

crabdata$amount.eaten <- crabdata$FoodIn-crabdata$FoodOut
all <- merge(crabdata, master, by="ID")
all$proportion.eaten <- (all$amount.eaten / all$WW)
#Changing date column into a date data type, so that R can read it as a Date.
all$Date.x = as.Date(all$Date.x, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

#Making all those who did not eat to 0
for(i in 1:nrow(all)){
  if(grepl("DE", all$Notes.x[i], fixed = TRUE)){
    all$proportion.eaten[i] = 0
  }
  if(grepl("AE", all$Notes.x[i], fixed = TRUE)){
    all <- all[-i, ] 
  }
  if(grepl("DI", all$Notes.x[i], fixed = TRUE)){
    all <- all[-i, ] 
  }
  if(is.na(all$amount.eaten[i])){
    all <- all[-i,]
  }
  else{
    if(all$amount.eaten[i] < 0){
      all$proportion.eaten[i] = 0
    }
  }
}

#Removing those that molted
array <- c()

for(i in 1:nrow(all)){
  if(grepl("ME", all$Notes.x[i], fixed = TRUE)){
    ID_value <- all$ID[i]
    for(j in 1:nrow(all)){
      if(all$ID[j] == ID_value){
        array <- c(array, j)
      }
    }
  }
}

all <- all[-array,]
array <- c()

unique(all$Food)

#removing mussel and mackerel feed
all <- subset(all, all$Food != "Mussels")
all <- subset(all, all$Food != "Mackerel")

```

1)  Data exploration. Quick glance at the data. Comparisons among species and seeing the relationship between carapace length and wet weight. I also take a glance at the Death data.

```{R}
ggplot(all, aes(y = CL, color = Species.x)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Boxplot of carapace length among species (species comparison/Outlier Detection)")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("CI" = "darkorange",
                                "CM"="darkgreen",
                                "HS"="darkred"))

ggplot(all, aes(y = proportion.eaten, color = Species.x)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Boxplot of proportion eaten among species (species comparison/Outlier Detection)")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("CI" = "darkorange",
                                "CM"="darkgreen",
                                "HS"="darkred"))

ggplot(all, aes(x = WW, y = CL, color = Species.x)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Relationship between carapace length and wet weight (Outlier detection)")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("CI" = "darkorange",
                                "CM"="darkgreen",
                                "HS"="darkred"))
#There is an outlier who is CM 176 - I am willing to throw this individual out since he is the only one of it's kind
all <- subset(all, all$ID != "CM176")

#Removing Hemi row - killed due to human error
death <- subset(death, death$Species != "HS")
death$Species <- factor(death$Species, levels=c("CM","CI"))
ggplot(death, aes(x = as.factor(Trial), fill = as.factor(Trial))) + geom_histogram(stat = "count") + facet_wrap(~Species) + ggtitle("Experiment Deaths across different trials and species (No deaths for Hemis)")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("20" = "darksalmon",
                                "22"="orange1",
                                "24"="orange3",
                                "26" = "orange4"))
```

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

-   Clear distinction between species:

    -   *Cancer irroratus* are larger than the other two species followed by *Carcinus meanus* then the smallest as *Hemigrapsus*.

    -   The pattern is opposite when it comes to the amount they've eaten proportionally. So *Hemigrapsus* eats the most and *Cancer irroratus* eats the least.

-   There is a nice relationship between carapace length and wet weight. However, there was an outlier. I have thrown it out since it's the ONLY one so far off, but I have checked and data was entered correctly.

-   *Cancer irroratus* have the highest death count among all 3 species with *Hemigrapsus* having none and *Carcinus meanus* only having two death counts. Across trials with *Cancer irroratus*, the higher the trial temperature the more deaths there are as well.


Next, I'll check for food type effects.

Checking for Outliers and that variables are normal

```{R}
#Pretty normal - looking good

holddf <- subset(all, all$Species.x == "CI")
ggplot(holddf, aes(x = WW)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 25, fill = "darkorange", color = "black") + facet_wrap(~Species.x, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Wet weight by species (normality visualization)")
#Interestingly enough, 22 and 26 Trial period 1 have higher size crabs than the rest of the trials

holddf <- subset(all, all$Species.x == "CM")
ggplot(holddf, aes(x = WW)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 18, fill = "darkgreen", color = "black") + facet_wrap(~Species.x, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Proportion eaten by species (normality visualization)")

holddf <- subset(all, all$Species.x == "HS")
ggplot(holddf, aes(x = WW)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "darkred", color = "black") + facet_wrap(~Species.x, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Proportion eaten by species (normality visualization)")

ggplot(all, aes(x = proportion.eaten, fill = Species.x)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) + facet_wrap(~Species.x, scales = "free") + ggtitle("Proportion eaten by species (normality visualization)")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("CI" = "darkorange",
                                "CM"="darkgreen",
                                "HS"="darkred"))
#everyone looks normal except for hemigrapsus which has some trialing end points
```

Get last 3 values to average out and compare among species and trial.

```{R}
avg_list <- NA
species_list <- NA
trial_list <- NA
period_list <- NA
sample_list <- NA

preload_spp <- c("CI", "CM", "HS")
preload_tr <- c("26", "24", "22", "20", "18", "16")

for(a in 1:length(preload_spp)){
  for(b in 1:length(preload_tr) ){
    for(i in 1:2){
      holddf <- subset(all, all$Species.x == preload_spp[a])
      holddf <- subset(holddf, holddf$Trial.x == preload_tr[b])
      holddf <- subset(holddf, holddf$Period == i)
      holddf$Date.x <- as.Date(holddf$Date.x)
      last.dates <- sort(unique(holddf$Date.x))
      last.dates <- tail(last.dates, 3)
      holddf <- subset(holddf, holddf$Date.x == last.dates[1] | holddf$Date.x == last.dates[2] | holddf$Date.x == last.dates[3])
      avg_list <- append(avg_list, mean(holddf$proportion.eaten))
      species_list <- append(species_list, holddf$Species.x[1])
      trial_list <- append(trial_list, holddf$Trial.x[1])
      period_list <- append(period_list, holddf$Period[1])
      sample_list <- append(sample_list, nrow(na.omit(holddf)))
    }
  }
}

average_df <- data.frame(avg_list, species_list, trial_list, period_list, sample_list)
average_df <- na.omit(average_df)

ggplot(average_df, aes(x = species_list, y = avg_list, color = as.factor(trial_list))) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(average_df, aes(x = species_list, y = avg_list, color = as.factor(trial_list))) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~period_list)
```

Checking Sample size

```{R}
table(all$Species.x, all$Trial.x)
```

Let's look into size affects on proportional eaten.

```{R}
mod <- lm(all$proportion.eaten~all$WW)
coef(mod)

mod1 <- glm(all$proportion.eaten ~ all$WW + all$Species.x + all$Trial.x)
summary(mod1)
```

Seems like weight has an affect on proportional amount eaten. This slope between weight and proportional amount eaten also changes between species. Furthermore, the trial that each individual is in affects the proportional amount eaten.
